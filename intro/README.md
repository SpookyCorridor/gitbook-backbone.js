# Introduction

<p>Backbone is considered to be a <em>model-view-whatever</em> framework. It offers you a set of tools that
allow you to easily create re-usable objects in HTML (the Views), bind data to these views from a server or locally (the Models),
allows you to create Collections of Models with corresponding models (great for large data sets), and allows you to trigger
Javascript functions through the application URI using the Router.</p>
