## 1. Building your foundation
**Backbone doesn't enforce design patterns**

<p>While these tools are great, Backbone does not force any standard convention of development on you - you're free to use
any design pattern(s) you wish. Because of this, it is very easy for one developer to use "Directives", another to use "Controllers",
and it can become incredibly easy to have an application that is not DRY.</p>

<p>It is entirely up to you to design architecture for your client side application. Before starting on your Backbone project, you should
create a set of standards for developers to follow. This "book" will introduce concepts that I have found useful while building out
a large scale, enterprise application. That said - feel free to make
<a href="https://github.com/Backbone-Enterprise-Book/Backbone-Enterprise-Book.github.io" target="_blank">a commit yourself</a>
with any additional suggestions, corrections, or ideas. Examples will be provided in the
<a href="https://github.com/Backbone-Enterprise-Book/Backbone-Enterprise-Book.github.io" target="_blank">Github repository</a>.
The examples will also be made available on jsFiddle.</p>
