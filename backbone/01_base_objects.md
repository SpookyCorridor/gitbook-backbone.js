## 1. Creating base Backbone objects</h1>
**Using inheritance in your Views, Models, and more**

<p>To demonstrate, we will start with creating a View for a table. We'll get started by outlining our application's structure.</p>

<p>Next, we need to create our models and collections:</p>

<p>We'll also need to create some templates for the Table and each child row. I'll use Handlebars.js to quickly create some templates
based on Bootstrap 3.x:</p>
